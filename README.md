## Custom Loading Spinner for Cloud User Portal

Display a more visibly prominent loading spinner when processing pages on the Cloud User Portal so that end users are aware that the form is being processed/loaded.  The intent is to augment the visibility of the OOB (out-of-the-box) spinner (i.e. three dots (“…”)) in the header.


## ServiceNow Release

## Installation Steps

There is one update set to:
